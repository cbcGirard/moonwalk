The learning curve *can* be rather intimidating, but some helper tools can make it much easier to work with. The process is more like programming than the usual word processors: everything starts as plain text, with some files dedicated to defining styles and formatting, and others the actual content of the document; in a separate step, LaTeX processes them into a unified document (usually .pdf). 

Because it's like writing code, it's convenient to prepare your project in [Visual Studio Code](/faves/vscode.html) with [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop); be sure to read the installation instructions for the extension, as it'll help you install a suitable version of LaTeX.
